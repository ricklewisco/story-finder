# Rule Quiz MVP

## Description

The Rule Quiz is a tool designed to help users discover their unique strengths and growth areas related to seven fundamental "rules" and their corresponding qualities: Authenticity, Courage, Vulnerability, Diligence, Significance, Authentic Relationship, and Integrity of Purpose. It acts as an entry point to self-discovery by identifying areas where users naturally excel at breaking limiting rules or areas where they may struggle.
